	abstract = {We study symplectic numerical integration of mechanical systems with a Hamiltonian specified in non-canonical coordinates and its application to guiding-center motion of charged plasma particles in magnetic confinement devices. The technique combines time-stepping in canonical coordinates with quadrature in non-canonical coordinates and is applicable in systems where a global transformation to canonical coordinates is known explicitly but its inverse is not. A fully implicit class of symplectic Runge-Kutta schemes has recently been introduced and applied to guiding-center motion by Zhang et al. (2014) [9]. Here a generalization of this approach with emphasis on semi-implicit partitioned schemes is described together with methods to enhance performance, in particular avoiding evaluation of non-canonical variables at full time steps. For application in toroidal plasma confinement configurations with nested magnetic flux surfaces a global canonicalization of coordinates for the guiding-center Lagrangian by a spatial transform is presented that allows for pre-computation of the required map in a parallel algorithm in the case of time-independent magnetic field geometry. Guiding-center orbits are studied in stationary magnetic equilibrium fields of an axisymmetric tokamak and a realistic three-dimensional stellarator configuration. Superior long-term properties of symplectic methods are demonstrated in comparison to a conventional adaptive Runge-Kutta scheme. Finally statistics of fast fusion alpha particle losses over their slowing-down time are computed in the stellarator field on a representative sample, reaching a speed-up of the symplectic Euler scheme by more than a factor three compared to usual Runge-Kutta schemes while keeping the same statistical accuracy and linear scaling with the number of computing threads.},

Simulations including the separatrix and scrape-off layer are exercised for a model DIII-D H-mode plasma. Neutral particle recycling is modeled by means of ionization and charge exchange with the plasma. A fully nonlinear Fokker–Planck collision operator is utilized to account for non-Maxwellian edge plasma. The study yields kinetic evidence that (i) neglecting the non-axisymmetric component of the RMP-generated electrostatic potential perturbation could yield a fictitiously high particle pump-out rate in the edge pedestal; that (ii) the experimental level of particle pump-out from the pedestal cannot be provided by collisional transport across Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser surfaces except across the magnetic separatrix where stochastic magnetic field lines exist; that (iii) the H-mode type electron heat barrier is retained in the steep slope area under the M3D-C1 calculated RMPs; and that (iv) the stochastic electron heat-transport rate around the magnetic separatrix surface is much lower than the prediction by Rechester–Rosenbluth (1978 Phys. Rev. Lett. 40 38–41) and is qualitatively consistent with the experimentally observed rate. Detailed kinetic physics analysis on how the transport fluxes, electrostatic potential perturbation, and -well structure respond to onset of RMPs is also reported.},

The role of fluid resonances is studied, in particular the role of the resonance associated with the equilibrium electric field reversal point Er = 0. Like the electron fluid resonance associated with the zero of the total perpendicular electron fluid velocity, the Er = 0 resonance may lead to enhanced transport due to the reduction of RMP shielding in the pedestal region where the RMP field can even be amplified by this resonance.

Including the ion polarization current gives the time rate of change of the radial electric field and related evolution of the rotation velocity components. A special orbit initialization for a quiescent start and an efficient radial flux solving algorithm with reduced numerical noise are developed. Numerical stability of the method with respect to the strength of the perpendicular viscosity and Mach number of the poloidal rotation is investigated. This new approach enables one to separate the nonambipolar transport characteristics from the ambipolar ones. Because nonambipolar transport can support sheared flows, this model can provide a very efficient tool for studying transport barriers and related neoclassical mechanisms in toroidal plasmas.},

Plasmas 19, 072505 (2012)], a gyrokinetic neoclassical study is performed with gyrokinetic ions and drift-kinetic electrons. Besides the gyrokinetic improvement of ion physics from the drift-kinetic treatment, a fully non-linear Fokker-Planck collision operator—that conserves mass, momentum, and energy—is used instead of Koh et al.'s linearized collision operator in consideration of the possibility that the ion distribution function is non-Maxwellian in the steep pedestal. An inaccuracy in Koh et al.'s result is found in the steep edge pedestal that originated from a small error in the collisional momentum conservation. The present study concludes that (1) the bootstrap current in the steep edge pedestal is generally smaller than what has been predicted from the small banana-width (local) approximation [e.g., Sauter et al., Phys. Plasmas 6, 2834 (1999) and Belli et al., Plasma Phys. Controlled Fusion 50, 095010 (2008)], (2) the plasma flow evaluated from the local approximation can significantly deviate from the non-local results, and (3) the bootstrap current in the edge pedestal, where the passing particle region is small, can be dominantly carried by the trapped particles in a broad trapped boundary layer. A new analytic formula based on numerous gyrokinetic simulations using various magnetic equilibria and plasma profiles with self-consistent Grad-Shafranov solutions is constructed.},

	abstract = {External resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) can modify the magnetic topology in a tokamak. In this case the magnetic ﬁeld cannot generally be described by ideal MHD equilibrium equations in the vicinity of resonant magnetic surfaces where parallel and perpendicular relaxation timescales are comparable. Usually, resistive MHD models are used to describe these regions. In the present work, a kinetic model is used for this purpose. Within this model, plasma response, current and charge density are computed with help of a Monte Carlo method, where guiding center orbit equations are solved using a semianalytical geometrical integrator. Besides its higher eﬃciency in comparison to usual integrators this method is not sensitive to noise in ﬁeld quantities. The computed charges and currents are used to calculate the electromagnetic ﬁeld with help of a ﬁnite element solver. A preconditioned iterative scheme is applied to search for a self-consistent solution. The discussed method is aimed at the nonlinear kinetic description of RMPs in experiments on Edge Localized Mode (ELM) mitigation by external perturbation coil systems without simpliﬁcation of the device geometry.},

This method has been treated by various writers, and solutions are available for telegraph lines with simple terminal conditions. It is well known that the extension of the same methods to more complicated terminal conditions, which represent the usual terminal apparatus, leads to great difficulties. The present paper attacks the same problem from the alternative standpoint of the steady-state characteristics of the system. This method has the advantage over the method of transients that the complication of the circuit which results from the use of terminal apparatus does not complicate the calculations materially. This method of treatment necessitates expressing the criteria of distortionless transmission in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Accordingly, a considerable portion of the paper describes and illustrates a method for making this translation. A discussion is given of the minimum frequency range required for transmission at a given speed of signaling. In the case of carrier telegraphy, this discussion includes a comparison of single-sideband and double-sideband transmission. A number of incidental topics is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Symplectic integrators offer many benefits for numerically approximating solutions to Hamiltonian differential equations, including bounded energy error and the preservation of invariant sets. Two important Hamiltonian systems encountered in plasma physics—the flow of magnetic field lines and the guiding center motion of magnetized charged particles—resist symplectic integration by conventional means because the dynamics are most naturally formulated in non-canonical coordinates. New algorithms were recently developed using the variational integration formalism; however, those integrators were found to admit parasitic mode instabilities due to their multistep character. This work eliminates the multistep character, and therefore the parasitic mode instabilities via an adaptation of the variational integration formalism that we deem “degenerate variational integration.” Both the magnetic field line and guiding center Lagrangians are degenerate in the sense that the resultant Euler-Lagrange equations are systems of first-order ordinary differential equations. We show that retaining the same degree of degeneracy when constructing discrete Lagrangians yields one-step variational integrators preserving a non-canonical symplectic structure. Numerical examples demonstrate the benefits of the new algorithms, including superior stability relative to the existing variational integrators for these systems and superior qualitative behavior relative to non-conservative algorithms.},

But, due to its flexibility, it also can be used to solve more general linear kinetic transport equations by applying a stochastic rather than a numerical or analytical method of solution. Major applications of EIRENE are in connection with plasma fluid codes, in particular with the various versions of the B2 two-dimensional plasma edge fluid code. The combined code package B2-EIRENE was developed, again initially for TEXTOR applications, in the late 1980s. It too has become a standard tool in plasma edge science. It is currently mainly used for divertor configurations, such as by the ITER central team, to assist the design of the ITER divertor.

DKES and NEO-MC codes are employed; the latter has allowed, for the ﬁrst time, the precise computation of the bootstrap transport coefﬁcient in the long-mean-free-path regime of this device. The low error bars allow a precise convolution of the monoenergetic coefﬁcients, which is conﬁrmed by error analysis. The radial proﬁle of the bootstrap current is presented for the ﬁrst time for the 100 44 64 conﬁguration of TJ-II for three different collisionality regimes. The bootstrap coefﬁcient is then compared with that of other conﬁgurations of TJ-II regularly operated. The results show qualitative agreement with toroidal current measurements; precise comparison with real discharges is ongoing.},

	abstract = {Curvilinear guiding-centre drift and full-orbit equations of motion are presented as implemented in the VENUS-LEVIS code. A dedicated interpolation scheme based on Fourier reconstruction in the toroidal and poloidal directions and cubic spline in the radial direction of flux coordinate systems is detailed. This interpolation method exactly preserves the order of the RK4 integrating scheme which is crucial for the investigation of fast particle trajectories in 3D magnetic structures such as helical saturated tokamak plasma states, stellarator geometry and resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP). The initialisation of particles with respect to the guiding-centre is discussed. Two approaches to implement RMPs in orbit simulations are presented, one where the vacuum field is added to the 2D equilibrium, creating islands and stochastic regions, the other considering 3D nested flux-surfaces equilibrium including the RMPs.},

	abstract = {A global plasma turbulence simulation code, ORB5, is presented. It solves the gyrokinetic electrostatic equations including zonal flows in axisymmetric magnetic geometry. The present version of the code assumes a Boltzmann electron response on magnetic surfaces. It uses a Particle-In-Cell (PIC), δf scheme, 3D cubic B-splines finite elements for the field solver and several numerical noise reduction techniques. A particular feature is the use of straight-field-line magnetic coordinates and a field-aligned Fourier filtering technique that dramatically improves the performance of the code in terms of both the numerical noise reduction and the maximum time step allowed. Another feature is the capability to treat arbitrary axisymmetric ideal MHD equilibrium configurations. The code is heavily parallelized, with scalability demonstrated up to 4096 processors and 109 marker particles. Various numerical convergence tests are performed. The code is validated against an analytical theory of zonal flow residual, geodesic acoustic oscillations and damping, and against other codes for a selection of linear and nonlinear tests.},
